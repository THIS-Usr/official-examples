# Getting Started
This example is the template for a simple decentralized application (dApp) using vanilla JavaScript. It utilizes the Radix dApp Toolkit to interact with the Radix Ledger via the Gateway API and the Radix Wallet.

In the `vanilla-js-dapp` directory:
run `npm install` to install the dependencies and then `npm run dev` to start the development server.
